#  CustomerSegmentAI360 - Final Year Project

**University Project | BSc Computer Science | 2025**

##  Project Overview
CustomerSegmentAI360 is a complete end-to-end customer segmentation and predictive modeling system for e-commerce platforms. The system helps businesses better understand their customers by applying machine learning techniques for segmentation, churn prediction, and CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) estimation.

##  Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Streamlit (interactive dashboard)
- Plotly & Seaborn (visualizations)
- SHAP (model explainability)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel/CSV for exports
- Git for version control

##  Key Features
- RFM & behavioral feature engineering
- KMeans clustering and segment profiling
- Multiple predictive models (Churn, CLV)
- SHAP explainability and model comparison
- Professional Streamlit dashboard with:
  - CSV upload
